1. Resource File
2. Script File


1. The Resource File
On the robot, this file must be called "robot.res"
Every robot uses hardware; This file defines what hardware the robot uses.  It also tells the VirtualRobot what pieces of hardware to initialize.
To define a piece of hardware:
@
    Each line with a definition starts with a pound.
Type name
    After the @ is the type of some hardware.
    For example, RELAY, VICTOR, SOLENOID, INT, FLOAT. A full list of hardware is in a table somewhere. Find it later. 
Programmer name
    The name this piece of hardware will be called in your script.
Value
    For hardware, this is the port it is plugged in to. Depending on the type of hardware, it may have multiple port numbers.
    For variables, this is the starting value and is optional.

Example:
@RELAY pusherRelay
defines a relay with name pusherRelay

2. The Script File
On the robot, this file must be called "robot.scr"
This is the script that the robot uses to tell it what to do. It can tell it to get input from the joysticks or to send a message to the dashboard.
This script has NO SCOPE.  
Variables are declared on the fly by a "@new type name", ex.
    @new FLOAT myFloat
defines a variable of type float called myFloat.
Valid types are FLOAT, INT, BOOLEAN.
Variables are reset every pass through the script.
If you need more complex logic not possible in this script then you can create classes for each instance of logic and call
    NATIVE this.is.the.package.ClassName
where this.is.the.package is the package the class is contained in in the NetBeans project, and ClassName is the name of the class. See text file "Using custom java in your FRCBasic script" for more.

commands
    NATIVE
    PRINT
    GOTO
    IF / ELSE
    SET for motors, etc
    GET for sensors
    
    1*(4+2)*(4-5%6)
